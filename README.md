## Warning!
I'm remaking this app to work with latest Fall Guys Updates and this remake is still in progress. The current version of img2FGC by [@repinek](https://github.com/repinek) may not work right now.

# ImgToFGC
Convert image to Fall Guys Creative Level! <br>
NOTE: Although I donâ€™t believe that you can get banned for this, but be careful!

## Question and answers 
Can I get banned using this?
> There has not been a single case of a player being banned for using mods/scripts, including creative ones. But in any case, the developer does not take responsibility, use it at your own risk!

I want to change the colors, but when I go to the block I see strange numbers and letters
> These symbols are the HEX code.
If you want to find out the HEX code, there are two ways to do this:
- via Fall Guys
1. Choose Block
2. Choose save position
3. Write HEX code

## Requirements
- For source code:
1. Python 3
2. Run install_requirements.bat
- Exe version
1. FallGuysTools to load json map (not necessary if you know how to load map)

## Features 
- Convert image to Fall Guys Creative 
- Digital/Original Theme
- Delete white/black pixels

## Usage
- With [FallGuysTools](https://discord.gg/MpGcpZT4pY)
1. Set config in GUI
2. Click "Generate Level"
3. After generation go to Load creative tab and click "Replace existing maps with level"
4. Open any map

- Without FallGuysTools
1. Run ImgToFGC
2. After generation the map file will be saved in "AppData\LocalLow\Mediatonic\FallGuys_client\" with name "Img2FGC.json"
3. Now, you need to load this json file in to the game, good luck! (if you dont know how to do it, use FallGuysTools)
